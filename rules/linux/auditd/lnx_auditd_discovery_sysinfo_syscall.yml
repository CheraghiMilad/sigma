title: Discovery System Info via sysinfo syscall
id: b207d563-a1d9-4275-b349-77d1eb55aa6d
status: experimental
description: The sysinfo system call in Linux provides a snapshot of key system statistics, such as uptime, load averages,
             memory usage, and the number of running processes. malware or reconnaissance tools might leverage sysinfo to
             fingerprint the systemâ€”gathering data to determine if it's a viable target.
